* Diagosis/Challenges
** geometry
- geometric theorems on circles and triangles stand to be familiarized
  to make problem solving effective
- radian angles are crucial and should be familiarized with
** complex number
- complex number calculation (to higher powers) can be tricky and
  should be practiced for efficiency
** word problems
- silly mistakes can be made occationally from not reading carefully
- understanding key math concepts in problems (percent growth, etc) is
  crucial to solving problems
* Overall Comments
- Great effort in excersices and fully concentrated on the materials
- Making progress in trignometry and its functions well 
- Recurring topics indicate lacking of in-depth understanding on
  concepts
- problems involving comprehensive understanding in a combination of
  topics stand to be challenging
* Sidenotes
** note taking & high lighting
- use underlines, circles, symbols and more to help mark out key
  information from problems; read carefully
** trignometry & geometry
- many theorems regarding shapes (circle, triangle, etc.), lengths
  (mid point) and lines (perpendicular, parallel) shoulde be
  remembered through practice
- trignometric functions should be practiced heavily to reenforce
  memory
** Concept Checks
- radians (angles)
- a constant (in a function or algebraic expresion)
- median & mean
- percent growth
- tan, sin, cos
- congruence, similarity
- equation of a circle, center of a circle
- chord of a circle
