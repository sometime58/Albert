** 3 mistakes commonly made in SAT 
*** thinking you're done with the problem, but you're not 
- most of the time, on the SAT you DO NOT solve for an independent
  variable 
- x^2 + y^2 = 153; y = -4x 
- if (x, y) is a solution to the system of equations above, what is
  the value of x^2 (2x - 3)? 
*** not reading carefully enough 
- Jane and three of her friends split the cost of gas on a road
  trip. If then total amount of gas they purchased was $32, how much
  did each pay? (10.6666 -> 11 (dollar) -> 10.67 (cent) Jane and 2 other friends round it to the nearest
  dollar/cent)) 
- boys and girls are in a ratio of 4 to 7 ... (4/11 kids are boys) 
- shoes are on sale - original price $120, now price is $100
  (percentage of discount) (120 - 100)/120 * 100 % (0.1 -> 0.1 * 100 =
  10 -> 10%) 
*** giving up 
- you do not lose points giving a wrong answer 
- strategies (maybe skip the hardest questions and come back to them
  later) 
* general tips 
- do not need to memorise a lot for maths 
- clarify and be certain about everything before moving on 
- when approaching practice tests, try to think about what each
  question is asking 
- math
