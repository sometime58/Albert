* exercise notes 
** 12 
- minus a negative number -(-3) = positive number +3 
** 13 (p = 14.7 +3 0.439d) 
- when solving problems with an equation indicating mathematical
  relations: 
- 1) read the variables, what they stand for and what are their
  disparate units 
- 2) draw the graph for the equation to visualise 
- 3) try specific values (d = 0, 1, 2) to help understand better how
  variables co-change 
- 4) solve for the value in question 
** 18 
- when unknown variable(s) in denominator, try to move to the
  numerator on the other side of the equation by multiplying both
  sides with the denominator 
** 19 
- sin = opposite side/hypotenuse 
- cos = neigbouring side/hypotenuse 
- 2 acute angles x, y in a straight triangle, sin x = cos y, cos x =
  sin y 
** 20 
- when having both sides of the equation in the same format,
  correspond the constants from each side to find the values for
  constant variables
* technique 
** read through the question 
** highlight important pieces of information 
** design valid approaches 
** carry out your planned process to find the answer
