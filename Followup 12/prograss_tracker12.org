* Topics Covered
** Review topics (reinforcer)
- radical and rational expressions & equations (algebraic operations)
- abstractions
- quadratic equations and number of solutions (delta, line of symmetry)
- triangle similarity
- ratio (word problems)
- arc length, arc angle and radians
- statistics and graphs (linear equation, quadratic equation,  modelling)
- circle equations
*** excersice problems
- test problems 6.3.9, 6.3.12, 6.3.13, 6.3.16, 6.3.18, 6.3.19, 6.3.20,
  6.4.9, 6.4.15, 6.4.19, 6.4.23, 6.4.25, 6.4.26, 6.4.30, 6.4.38
* Diagosis/Challenges
** abstraction
- standard process for abstracting from numerator
- precision for calculation
- finding the way to convert a given form of expression to the wanted
  form of expression
** circle, radian and arc lengths and angles
- concepts relating to and relation between arc length, radian, and
  angle
- finding an angle's corresponding arc
- general circle equations
** word problems
- when presented with a heavy load of information, find a way to break
  it down and translate each piece into mathematical equations/inequalities
* Overall Comments
- Great effort in excersices and fully concentrated on the materials
- Becoming more familiar with SAT test topics and getting more
  correct answers
- Need to be more familiar with fundamental concepts under certain
  topics (circle, quadratic equations, etc.)
* Sidenotes
- do check in to see if test answers have been sent
** Further practice guide
- Can write down helper equations and formulas next to the question
  for comparison to reach an answer
- Need to start timing practice tests and see how well progress is
  made under time pression
- Note down problems that pose challenge and reflect on time consumed
  for each problem
** Concept Checks
- delta, number of solutions, line of symmetry
- pothagorean theorem
- general form for equations for circles
