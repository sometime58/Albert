* Topics Covered
** Review topics (reinforcer)
- Radical and rational exponents
- Radical and rational equations
*** excersice problems
- review problems 2.5.3 - 2.5.6, 2.6.3 - 2.6.7
* Diagosis/Challenges
** radical and rational exponents and equations
- taking terms out of squareroots
- negative expoents (remember to flip the base)
- fractional squareroots calculation
- simplification techniques (how to get rid of squareroots, combine
  terms, etc.)
- foiling products (quatratic expressions and functions in particular)
  (use the general term formular when needed) 
- legal and illegal moves in combining terms and simplification
** polinomials and quadratic formula
- remember the use of delta and its implication on number of solutions
- having 1 solution/2 solutions/no solution
- checking domains (squareroots, denominator (dividing zero), log
  functions)
* Overall Comments
- Great effort in excersices and fully concentrated on the materials
- Becoming confident in simplification of exponential terms and
  rational terms
* Sidenotes
- do check in to see if test answers have been sent
** Further practice guide
- Need greater familiarity with simplification processes and techniques
- Need greater understanding in multiple solutions and real solutions
  memory
** Concept Checks
- quadratic formula, delta
- radical operations (legal, illegal)
- radical -> rational; rational -> radical
- general form of quadratic equations
